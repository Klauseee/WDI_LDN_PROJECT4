# WDI-32 Project 4 - Jobbly

![image](src/assets/images/jbly-logo.png)

Jobbly is an app intended to reduce the stress of looking for a new job and ultimately saving both jobseekers and employers time on pointless applications.
In much the same way as modern dating apps, jobseekers and employers have to like each other before an application can take place.

Our app is a mobile responsive MERN stack application styled using BULMA CSS framework, featuring packages such as react-hammerjs, jsonwebtoken and filestack.
We wrote a backend testing suite using NYC and mocha and a frontend testing suite using mocha and enzyme.

Throughout the project we used trello to organise and designate tasks and responsibilities. Initially we specified our MVP requirements before listing our desired features in order of importance.

It was essential that this app works on mobile, we therefore made sure that every function we added would be suitable for a mobile device. We also added swipe gestures so that users could decide on job opportunities as quickly as if they were on tinder.

The app works on the principle that when a user shows interest in a job listing, the employer can take a brief look at the user's profile and decide whether they might be suitable for the job. If the employer likes the user, the job will then turn up in the user's 'matched jobs' section on their profile. At this point, they simply click on an 'Apply' button which sends the employer an application, including the user's CV, via email.

We are very proud to have achieved what we did in 1 week. The app functions exactly as we intended it to. We are also very pleased with how it is presented.

In the future we would like to add...
